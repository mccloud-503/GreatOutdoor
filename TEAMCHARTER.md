What is a Team Charter? (copied from Canvas)
Teamwork is essential, but it can be challenging when team members aren’t physically together. That’s where a team charter comes in.
A team charter is a document that clearly outlines the roles, responsibilities, and expectations for each team member. It helps create structure and keeps everyone on the same page, making collaboration smoother and more effective.
Creating a team charter involves two steps:
Brainstorming – Gather input from everyone on the team.
Consolidating – Combine everyone’s ideas into a set of agreed-upon rules and guidelines.
Why a Team Charter is Important
A clear, shared vision which helps the team work toward common goals
Defined roles and responsibilities to clarify who does what.
It improves communication which encourages open and efficient communication.
It establishes clear goals and milestones to keep everyone focused on what needs to be achieved.
Builds trust and collaboration among team members.
